	Growth Form	
	        • Bunch: Plant development by intravaginal tillering at or near the soil surface without production of rhizomes or stolons.
	        • Colonizing: A plant that is likely to behave as a colonizer when planted to enhance soil stabilization.
	        • Multiple Stems: Plant development by producing two or more stems. Examples: roundleaf dogwood (Cornus rugosa) and red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium).
	        • Rhizomatous: Plant development by the production of rhizomes which give rise to vegetative spread.
	        • Single Crown: A herbaceous plant that develops one persistent base.
	        • Single Stem: Plant development by the production of one stem. Examples: corn (Zea mays) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia).
	        • Stoloniferous: Plant development by the production of stolons which give rise to vegetative spread.
	        • Thicket Forming: A plant that is likely to develop thickets when planted to stabilize soil.

	Height at 20 Years, Maximum (feet)	
	        Integer 
	        Maximum height (in feet) of a tree, shrub or sub-shrub, under ideal conditions, at a base age. The base age is 20 years for trees in temperate areas (>30 degrees north latitude), 10 years for trees in tropical areas (≤30 degrees north latitude), and 10 years for all shrubs and sub-shrubs. Ideal conditions are defined as soil pH = 5.0-7.8; soil salinity ≤ 4 mmhos/cm; soil depth ≥ 40 inches; effective average annual precipitation ≥ 30 inches; soil texture class = medium; no ponding; rare or no annual flooding; and high water table depth ≥ 1 foot during plant active growth period. Plants other than trees, shrubs, and sub-shrubs are left blank here.
	        
	        
	        
	        
	Height, Mature (feet)	
	        Integer 
	        Expected height (in feet) of plant at maturity. This is an estimate of the median mature height of all plants of a species or cultivar. Within a species mature height is quite variable, so this estimate is provided only to give a rough idea for planning purposes.
